# Snappy-Tappy
Gives the User the ability to use Snap-Tap/Snappy-Tappy without a keyboard which supports it.

## What is Snap-Tap/Snappy Tappy
Uses the latest keyboard input, which leads to the Player not stopping when as an example pressing W and S and instead uses the last input for the direction. With A and D the Player also normally starts walking in a straight line, while with this mod the last input counts.
